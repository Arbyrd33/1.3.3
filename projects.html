        <div id="sweatsbakery" class="post"><img src="/assets/sweet eats.gif"><p>-<i>"Sweet Eats Bakery", April 25th, 2022</i>-<br>This project started out very simple with minimal styling. We were tasked to see how much of the styling we could change without touching the HTML at all or using Flexbox. Here you can find the <a href="https://arbors-bakery-mockup.netlify.app/">original design</a> for the site, and you'll find an updated version of this project <a href="https://arbors-updated-bakery-mockup.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p></div>
        <div id="YosemiteGuide" class="post"><img src="/assets/yosemite.gif"><p>-<i>"Yosemite Park Guide", April 26th, 2022</i>-<br>This was really fun! I haven't added any special styling to this, so what you're looking at is something fresh out of the BloomTech syllabus; but I love thinking about one day designing a website for a park or other outdoor creative space.
